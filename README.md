# MyTinyAOP
## This is a tiny implementation of the AOP which stands for aspect oriented programming in Java.
### In this project, 3 types of customized annotations are created for marking corresponding aspect method for later injecting into object.
### The 3 types are: @Before, @After and @Around, which indicates how the origin method will be wrapped by those injected method.
### Everything in this project is implemented through JavaEE by utilizing Annotation and Reflection, and no other third-party library is used.
